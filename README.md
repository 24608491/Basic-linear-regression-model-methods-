Linear regression model methods

Three methods for traning a linear regresion model are investigated. Namely Stochastic gradient descent, mini-batch gradient descent and a multi-layered perceptron using R-Studio.

Stochastic gradient descent samples a data point to compute the gradient and uses it to adjust the parameters for the regression model.
Mini-Batch gradient descent samples several data points at once to compute the gradient and uses it to adjust the parameters for the regression model.
A multi-layered perceptron requires an architecture with the right activation function that is capable of modeling a linear regression model from the input data 

A csv file with two varaibles (x and y) was used to compare the 3 methods.
